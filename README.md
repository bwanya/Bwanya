# Hello World! 
I'm a bioinformatician dedicated to unraveling the complexities of biological data through advanced computational techniques. My work primarily revolves around:
**Transcriptomics Analyses**: I specialize in analyzing RNA-Seq data to understand gene expression patterns, differential expression, and functional annotation. My goal is to decipher the biological significance and regulatory mechanisms underlying various conditions and treatments.
**Machine Learning Predictions of Chemical Toxicity**: Leveraging machine learning algorithms, I predict chemical toxicity from gene expression data. By integrating computational methods and biological insights, I aim to contribute to safer chemical development and environmental health.
**Teaching and Mentoring**: As an educator, I guide undergraduate and master's students through the fascinating world of bioinformatics. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience, helping students to develop their skills in data analysis, programming, and research methodologies.
